Veronica Kemp Portfolio

This projects is to make a site that shows examples of my work and and present it in a UI/UX friendly way. It is mobile responsive along with using smooth scroll to make navigating a breeze.

This portfolio uses:
-Bootstrap
-Gulp
-jquery
-Sass
-JavaScript
-HTML
-CSS

I wanted to use a few things that I did know, but also some that I wasn't. JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap had been used before, but Sass and Gulp were brand new to me. For jQuery, even though it has phased out, I still wanted to have some familiarity with it especially in cases were I might be updating an application from jQuery to something else.
